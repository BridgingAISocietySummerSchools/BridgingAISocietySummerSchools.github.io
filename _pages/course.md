Welcome to the **Machine Learning for Interdisciplinary Audiences** course — a modular, discussion-driven program designed to introduce core machine learning (ML) concepts, practical tools, and societal implications to participants from diverse academic backgrounds.

Whether you're coming from the natural sciences, social sciences, or the humanities, this course is designed to be accessible, thought-provoking, and hands-on.

## 🧭 Course Structure

The course consists of five interconnected components that blend foundational knowledge, interactive practice, and critical reflection:

---

### 📣 1. Introductory Talk

We begin with a shared foundation: What is machine learning, and how does it work in practice?

This opening session creates a common language for all participants — no prior knowledge assumed. It introduces the key ideas and terminology needed to follow the rest of the course, including:

- What machine learning is and how it differs from traditional programming
- Common types of learning (e.g. supervised vs. unsupervised)
- The typical structure of an ML project (data, training, evaluation)
- Conceptual challenges like overfitting, generalization, and interpretability

The session ensures that everyone — regardless of disciplinary background — is equipped to meaningfully engage in both the technical and societal components that follow.

### 🧠 2. Technical Sessions

Over four 75-minute sessions, we explore key machine learning paradigms that power real-world applications:

- **Classification** — assigning labels to data
- **Regression** — predicting numerical outcomes
- **Tree-based models** — interpretable and powerful ensemble methods
- **Neural networks** — flexible models inspired by the brain

Each session includes a short instructor-led introduction, participant mini-presentations, and structured group discussion. The emphasis is on building intuition and understanding — not technical detail — so that all participants can confidently interpret and apply ML methods across disciplines.

### 💻 3. Python for Data Science Workshop

This 90-minute session offers a fast, beginner-friendly introduction to Python tailored for data science and machine learning. No prior programming experience is required.

Participants work in Jupyter notebooks and learn to:

- Use Python for basic logic and calculations
- Work with structured data using lists and dictionaries
- Manipulate datasets using `pandas`
- Visualize results using `matplotlib`
- Train simple models with `scikit-learn`

We build from first principles and end with a capstone project analyzing real weather data across multiple cities — integrating everything into a complete mini data science pipeline.

### 🔎 4. Hands-on Sessions

Theory comes to life in these 45-minute interactive notebooks. Participants use real code to explore how machine learning models behave — from visualizing decision boundaries to adjusting hyperparameters and observing how algorithms learn.

There’s no setup required: all materials run directly in the browser via **Google Colab**.

These sessions are designed to:

- Reinforce key ML concepts through experimentation
- Encourage intuition over equations
- Promote curiosity, exploration, and critical thinking

Topics include:

- Gradient descent and linear regression
- Decision trees and ensemble methods
- Neural networks and loss landscapes

Notebooks are progressive, beginner-friendly, and structured to support self-paced discovery with clear explanations and visual feedback.

### 🌍 5. Societal Topic Sessions

Finally, we zoom out and ask: **How does AI affect the world around us?**

In four 60-minute discussions, participants explore the ethical, legal, and societal dimensions of artificial intelligence — considering both opportunities and risks. These sessions are participant-led and discussion-based, drawing on the group’s disciplinary diversity to shape thoughtful, informed dialogue.

Core themes include:

- 🧭 The EU AI Act and global trends in AI regulation
- ⚖️ Algorithmic bias and fairness in decision-making
- 🏥 AI in healthcare and diagnostics — promises and pitfalls
- 📣 Misinformation, automation, and the future of work

Rather than reaching consensus, the goal is to develop critical perspectives and connect technical practice with real-world impact.
