> 📍 **Now live:** [**Banz 2025 — Course Website »**](/banz-2025/)

We design and deliver **interdisciplinary courses and workshops** that explore the technical foundations and societal implications of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Machine Learning (ML)**. Our modular teaching formats are accessible, discussion-driven, and adaptable — from summer schools to university seminars.

## 🧠 What We Offer

We support institutions and educators in bringing machine learning and AI into interdisciplinary classrooms. Our work includes:

- 🧩 **Tailored course design**, adapted to audience, duration, and goals
- 🐍 **Hands-on projects** using Python and interactive Colab notebooks
- 💬 **Discussion-based teaching formats** for mixed-discipline groups
- 🌍 **Societal deep-dives** on real-world AI issues — from healthcare to regulation
- 📚 **Open educational resources** that can be reused or remixed

Whether for a one-day workshop or a 10-day summer academy, our materials and formats scale flexibly to suit different settings.


## 🧭 Our Teaching Philosophy

Our approach is built on three pillars:

### 1. **Accessible Machine Learning**

We teach the *what*, *how*, and *why* of ML systems — using clear examples and visual explanations, not technical jargon. Core concepts include:

- Classification, regression, trees, and neural networks
- How ML differs from traditional programming
- Key challenges like generalization and interpretability

### 2. **Exploration by Doing**

Participants use real datasets and train real models. Through interactive notebooks, they:

- Visualize decision boundaries
- Tweak hyperparameters
- See how learning algorithms work in practice

Our **intro to Python workshop** supports absolute beginners, with no coding experience required.

### 3. **Societal Context**

From bias in algorithms to the EU AI Act, we link ML methods to their real-world consequences. Topics include:

- ⚖️ Fairness and discrimination in automated systems
- 🏥 AI in public health and diagnostics
- 📣 Automation, misinformation, and the future of work
- 🧭 Legal frameworks and global regulation

Participants contribute their own disciplinary lens — we provide the structure for dialogue.


## 💾 Explore Our GitHub Repositories

All of our teaching materials are open-source and classroom-tested:

- 📓 [**Hands-On Notebooks**](https://github.com/BridgingAISocietySummerSchools/Hands-On-Notebooks)
  Colab-ready exercises for interactive ML learning

- 🐍 [**Python for Data Science**](https://github.com/BridgingAISocietySummerSchools/Data-Science-AI-Python-Course)
  Beginner-friendly crash course in Python, pandas, and scikit-learn

Each repository includes setup instructions, example projects, and modular content blocks.


## 🌍 Where We've Taught

This program has been delivered in summer academies organized by the **Studienstiftung des Deutschen Volkes**, Germany’s national academic scholarship foundation. Past iterations include:

- 🇬🇧 2019 — *St. John’s College, Cambridge (UK)*, including students from St. John’s
- 🇩🇪 2021 — *Koppelsberg, Germany*
- 🇸🇮 2024 — *Ljubljana, Slovenia*
- 🇩🇪 2025 — *Banz Castle, Germany*, with students from the *College of Europe*

Each event brings together students from across disciplines — from philosophy, law, and economics to physics, biology, and computer science.

We continue to refine and adapt our program based on evolving challenges in AI and feedback from learners.
