## 🧭 What the Course Offers

👉 [Course » Overview](/course/)

Our flagship course — **Machine Learning for Interdisciplinary Audiences** — combines core ML concepts, hands-on experimentation, and critical reflection on AI’s role in society.

### 📣 Introductory Talk
A shared starting point that introduces the fundamentals of machine learning and builds common language across disciplines.

### 🧠 Foundational ML Topics
Four sessions covering classification, regression, tree-based models, and neural networks — taught with accessibility, not jargon.


👉 [Course » Technical Topics](/course/technical/)

### 💻 Python for Data Science
A fast-paced, beginner-friendly introduction to Python, Jupyter notebooks, and key libraries like `pandas` and `scikit-learn`.
No prior programming experience required.
