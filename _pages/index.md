# Bridging AI & Society â€“Â Interdisciplinary ML Education

We are **Dr. Christoph Weisser** and **Dr. Knut Zoch**, two educators with backgrounds in applied statistics and experimental physics. Together, we design and teach interdisciplinary courses and workshops that explore both the **technical foundations** of machine learning and the **societal questions** raised by artificial intelligence.

Our formats are interactive, adaptable, and discussion-driven â€” ranging from short workshops to multi-day academies.

## What We Do

Our courses help participants:
- Build a clear understanding of core machine learning ideas
- Experiment hands-on with data and simple models
- Reflect on the societal, ethical, and regulatory implications of AI
- Connect technical knowledge with perspectives from their own disciplines

We adapt each program to its audience â€” from compact university seminars to intensive summer schools.

## Experience and Partners

Our teaching has been part of programs run by the **Studienstiftung des Deutschen Volkes** (German National Academic Foundation) and in collaboration with other academic institutions.

Courses have taken place in settings such as **St. Johnâ€™s College, Cambridge (UK)**, **Ljubljana (Slovenia)**, and **Banz Abbey (Germany)**, bringing together participants from diverse academic backgrounds.
