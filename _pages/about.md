Artificial intelligence and machine learning are reshaping how we live, work, and think. Yet education in these areas is often fragmented â€” either highly technical or focused only on societal debates.

Our project exists to bridge this gap. We bring **technical foundations** and **societal perspectives** together in one classroom, creating space for students from diverse disciplines to learn, question, and collaborate.

## Teaching Philosophy

Our team believes that AI and machine learning education should not remain the domain of specialists alone. Our mission is to deliver an approach that is:

- **Accessible** â€” tailored to students and professionals from diverse disciplines
- **Hands-on** â€” focused on interactive coding and practical data analysis
- **Critical** â€” addressing fairness, transparency, regulation, and ethical questions
- **Interdisciplinary** â€” creating dialogue between natural sciences, social sciences, and the humanities

Our courses are designed to be both **practically useful** and **thought-provoking**, equipping participants with skills and perspectives they can carry into their own fields.

## Where Weâ€™ve Taught

Since 2019, our courses have been part of summer academies and workshops across Europe, often in collaboration with the *Studienstiftung des Deutschen Volkes* (German National Academic Foundation) and other academic partners.

- ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ **2019, Cambridge, UK** â€”Â St. Johnâ€™s College, Cambridge, with participants from Cambridge University.

- ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª **2021, Koppelsberg, Germany** â€”Â Interdisciplinary summer academy with participants from across Germany.

- ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡® **2024, Ljubljana, Slovenia** â€”Â Joint program with students from the *Max Weber Program, Elite Network of Bavaria*.

- ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª **2025, Banz Castle, Germany** â€”Â Summer academy with participants from the *College of Europe*.

Each of these programs brought together students from diverse disciplines â€” philosophy, law, economics, biology, physics, and more â€” creating a truly interdisciplinary dialogue on AI and society.

## Open Resources

All of our teaching materials are **open-source** and freely available on our [GitHub organisation page](https://github.com/BridgingAISocietySummerSchools):

- [**Hands-On Notebooks**](https://github.com/BridgingAISocietySummerSchools/Hands-On-Notebooks) â€“ Colab-ready exercises for interactive ML learning
- [**Python for Data Science**](https://github.com/BridgingAISocietySummerSchools/Data-Science-AI-Python-Course) â€“ A beginner-friendly crash course covering Python, pandas, and scikit-learn
- [**Coding Challenges**](https://github.com/BridgingAISocietySummerSchools/Coding-Project) â€“ Short projects inspired by real-world AI applications

Each repository includes setup instructions, example projects, and modular content blocks for educators and learners alike.
